A simple method is presented for estimating the RR from a PPG signal. The proposed
method is based on the two-pole digital resonator and fast Fourier transform (FFT)
algorithms. The proposed method is evaluated using the benchmark metrics on the
standard PPG datasets. Ardunio and matlab implementation of the same is implemented
successfully.
