Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common form of arrhythmia. AF is referred to as rapid heart-beat. AF is conventionally diagnosed by monitoring Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. This method of diagnosis is time consuming for Cardiologists. In order to address this challenge many Machine Learning (ML) models have been proposed. In this method proposed, the ECG signals are taken as three data-sets, one MIT-BIH dataset from Physio net for training the model. The dataset is pre-processed and from this pre-processed signal, features of ECG are extracted using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm. The extracted features are trained to the model using the U- NET model. This trained model helps in detecting if patients are affected by Atrial Fibrillation. The other two datasets are used in predicting if the patients are affected by Atrial Fibrillation. Testing this at an early stage of AF (Paroxysmal AF) reduces the risk for life. This method is aimed to achieve an accuracy of 96.89% and F1 score of 0.969.
