Drowsiness detection is the most necessary procedure to prevent any road accidents. The main aim of this project is to construct a smart alert technique for building intelligent vehicles that can automatically avoid drowsy driver impairment. Hence, it is required to design a robust alert system to avoid the cause of the mishap. In this project, we address a drowsy driver alert system that has been developed using such a technique in which the Video Stream Processing (VSP) is analysed by the eye blink concept through an Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Euclidean distance of the eye. The face landmark algorithm is also used as a proper way to eye detection. When the driverâ€™s fatigue is detected, the IoT module issues a warning message along with the impact of collision and location information, thereby alerting with the help of a voice speaking.
